**Industry:** Mental Health / Workplace Wellbeing / Professional Resilience  
**Part of AI App Challenge**  
**Building one AI app per day using vibe-coding , focused on one industry problem at a time.**

## ✅ Checklist (What this app will do)
- Identify common triggers behind AI-comparison anxiety at work
- Turn AI-related news into a realistic, supportive perspective (reframe)
- Provide quick, repeatable routines (before meetings, after doomscrolling, before sleep)
- Offer a professional-friendly “grounding + next step” plan in under 60 seconds
- Keep the experience calm, modern, and trustworthy for everyday use

---

## The Problem
Professionals are experiencing anxiety from AI comparisons and constant AI news. They worry they’re falling behind, becoming replaceable, or failing to keep up. Generic advice doesn’t stick, and the stress returns with every new headline, post, or workplace conversation.

---

## The Solution
**AI Reality Check** is a modern mental-health–focused app that helps professionals **reframe career anxiety triggered by AI news**. It turns fear-based headlines into balanced, actionable perspective—without dismissing feelings.

Core feature prompt:
> **“Reframe my career anxiety caused by AI news.”**

---

## Why This Requires a Purpose-Built App
General AI tools provide guidance in isolated interactions, but anxiety support needs **continuity, structure, and repeatable workflows**. A dedicated app can capture structured inputs, apply consistent mental-health–aligned logic, and guide users through the same calming flow every time—creating a reliable “check-in → reframe → action step” experience professionals can return to daily.

---

## Who This Is For
- Professionals feeling anxious or behind due to AI news and AI comparisons  
- High performers with “AI FOMO” and constant upskilling pressure  
- Managers and team leads trying to stay calm and confident in change  
- Anyone who doomscrolls AI content and feels stress spikes afterward  

---

## Prompt Used
> Design an app named **AI Reality Check** for professionals experiencing anxiety from AI comparisons and AI-driven news. The core function is: **“Reframe my career anxiety caused by AI news.”**  
> The app should be modern, engaging, and calming for professional users.  
> Include: AI news parsing or headline input, structured reframing prompts based on mental health best practices, supportive resources, and a repeatable daily workflow.  
> Provide deliverables as a detailed feature specification and UI wireframes. Include validation after each major feature to ensure it supports the core objective.

## Core Features (Detailed Spec)

### 1) Reality Check Input (choose 1)
**Goal:** capture the anxiety trigger quickly.
- Option A: Paste a headline or article snippet
- Option B: “What’s the thought?” (short text)
- Option C: Pick a trigger chip (e.g., “AI replaced my role”, “Everyone is using AI”, “I’m too late”)

**Validation:** If user can start in under **10 seconds**, proceed.

---

### 2) Anxiety Reframe Engine (structured output)
**Goal:** turn fear into clarity + control.
Outputs:
- **What the headline is saying (neutral summary)**
- **What it does *not* mean** (removes catastrophizing)
- **A realistic perspective** (balanced, professional tone)
- **1 micro-action** (something the user can do today)
- **A confidence line** (short, supportive)

**Validation:** If output is short, calming, and actionable, proceed.

---

### 3) “Compare Less” Mode (AI comparison anxiety)
**Goal:** stop spirals from comparing to AI or peers.
- Identify comparison type: speed, knowledge, productivity, job security
- Provide a reframe + boundary
- Provide a “today focus” (one controllable skill/action)

**Validation:** If user ends with a next step (not just reassurance), proceed.

---

### 4) Daily Routine Flows (repeatable)
**Goal:** make it a habit, not a one-time chat.
- **60-second Morning Reset**
- **Post-Doomscroll Cooldown**
- **Before-Meeting Confidence Boost**
- **End-of-Day Decompress**

**Validation:** If any flow can be completed in under **60 seconds**, proceed.

---

### 5) Resource & Support Layer (optional but safe)
**Goal:** helpful next steps without overstepping.
- Quick coping tools: breathing timer, grounding prompts
- Suggested boundaries: notifications, content filters
- “Talk to someone” section (general, non-crisis, informational)

**Validation:** Tone remains supportive, not clinical, and avoids medical claims.

---

## Output Format (What the user receives)
**AI Reality Check Result**
1. Trigger summary (1–2 lines)  
2. Reframe (3–5 bullets)  
3. What I can control today (1 action)
